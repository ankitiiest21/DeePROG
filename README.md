# Gene2Modality

## A Deep Multimodal Learning for Gene Function Prediction

> In this project, we have developed a deep multimodal architecture to predicting gene function. In this work, we have two different representation (modality) of disease related gene datasets. Here the two modalities are gene expression data and another is underlying amino acid sequence. For gene expression data, we have extracted features using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and for the amino acid sequence, we have exploited a long short term memory(LSTM).
