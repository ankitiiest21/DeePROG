In this multi-modal work, we have used 3D protein database structure as the second modality. Due to the big size(approx 80GB) of the file, we can not upload it in Github. To access the partial datasets please click the following google drive link

You can download the whole dataset by webcrawling. The python script(3D_PDB.ipynb) for web crawl is in the parent file.
